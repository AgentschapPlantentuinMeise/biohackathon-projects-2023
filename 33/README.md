# Project 33: The BioHackathon Cloud

## Abstract

We would like to propose the establishment of a "BioHackCloud" (BHC) - a cloud-based infrastructure for the federated analysis of biological/biomedical data based on Global Alliance for Genomics and Health (GA4GH) standards and other relevant open community standards. The ELIXIR Cloud & AAI GA4GH Driver Project-run “ELIXIR Cloud” infrastructure would serve as the initial BHC. It is now at a level of maturity that it can be used experimentally for executing CWL and Snakemake workflows, as well as running individual data-intensive tasks on a network of compute centers within ELIXIR.

The BHC will be offered to interested BioHackathon participants, with BHC project participants providing training and support for the realization of individual use cases (e.g., construction of API calls, modification of workflows, addition of features and integrations to the individual services). Feasibility will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis, but where use cases cannot be realized with the current infrastructure, future support of these use cases will be considered for the BHC roadmap.

Next to providing support for other participants, another main goal for the BHC project is the integration with other relevant services on the basis of open community standards. In particular, for this hackathon we will focus on furthering the interoperability with Microsoft’s native TES on Azure implementation (https://github.com/microsoft/ga4gh-tes). But integration of other community standards (e.g., RO-Crate) and implementations (e.g., WorkflowHub, Dockstore, BioContainers) is also possible, depending on participants' interests.

## More information

We will reach out to the leads of other project leads early (at least a month in advance) to get an understanding of possible use cases that we could support with the BHC and to prepare accordingly. For the integration goals, a project board with detailed issues will be prepared, and based on available participants and current needs, a common development theme with realistic milestones for the event will be set on Day 1.

Requirements for use cases which we can currently not support will be used to draft a BHC roadmap on Day 5, to be addressed at or in preparation of future events. To support use cases and drive development, we estimate that we would need at least 6 contributors (the more, the better) with different skill sets (e.g., coding in Python, Javascript/Typescript; devops/Kubernetes; workflows; containers; data analysis) and varying degrees of experience.
